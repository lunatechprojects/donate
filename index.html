Reintroduction Organization profile 2017 ABOUT Donations for children,s organization is a development Wash organization that was founded to improve access to sefe and clean water among people in water poor communities in Uganda. East Africa. We embrace humanity through providing safe water solution's to water poor communities in Uganda.
<BR>
Our mission: provide safe water solution's to people in water- poor communities. We provide safe water, sanitation & hyigien tools and solution to people living in remote areas in Uganda where clean drinking water is no reality. Our work focuses on building self_sustaining communities that effectively manage their own Water resources for more productive and heltheir lives.
We work with communities and their leadership in two main areas: clean water wash Education.<BR>
The problem is that may village across Lwengo District Bukomansibi District and neighboring communities still lack to safe and clean water.hundreds of households and school in these communities depend on open water courses which are often contaminated by running water of human and animal waste and also put the users to the risk of contaminating diseases from animals since these water point are shered with domestic and wild animals school going children spend many hours going to collect unsefe water from an sefe water sources learner's fectch water from an sefe water source after walking for over 30 to the source and from Open water source also put people at risk of drawing and most at-risk group
We managed to consutruct some of protected spring that are identified local people in their communities.Spring are sustainable and reliable water sources that many villages depend on for Water unfortunately, when these springs are not protected, their water is contaminated since it is shared wild animals and other kinds of waste including human waste. Our solution is to protect these reliable sources of water by covering this water and puting inoutlet on this infrastructure where people can collect clean and safe water in the easiest way. We are currently implementing a project where are construction 37 protected spring in Lwengo and Bokomansimbi District. Right now our project is running out of funding we there for Request for any support if possible in order go further.
